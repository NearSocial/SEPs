## Summary

This document serves to come to an agreement on a specification for a new "Groups" experience on Near Social, designed to allow people to create and discover communities around specific topics, interests, projects, governance, etc.

## Motivation

We need a SocialDB standard for groups to support discoverability on near.org and interoperability between gateways and dApps to mitigate the [compatibility problems](https://near.social/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.Post?id=1034) which arise when dApps build distinct implementations of communities.


## UX Goals

1. To allow a group of users to moderate with sovereignty a scope of socialDB limited to the members of the group. e.g. group members have read + write access to the group's socialDB namespace. 
1. Non-members only have read-only access to view group content
1. Group members should receive notifications for all relevant social interactions in a group (e.g. Like, Reply for Posts and Discussions)
1. All content posted to groups that a user is part of should appear the user’s "Following" activity feed. 
1. Leaving a group will stop content from appearing on a user’s feed.
1. Group content should only appear in the “All” activity feed if a group member reposts a group post to the main feed.
1. One should be able to retrieve a list of all groups in socialDB
1. One should be able to retrieve a list of all users in a group.
1. One should be able to search for groups, where search text is matched against the group's name and metadata.


## Rationale and Alternatives

A key success metric of this standard is to provide a minimal blueprint that gateways can build upon to ensure feature parity, in the UX goals above, across gateways. 

Prior art: 

1. near.social's NFT-based groups

The [group's post page](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=mob.near/widget/N.Group&tab=source); passing to this page an NFT's contractID as the groupId query param will [render the group details](https://near.org/mob.near/widget/N.Group?groupId=v0.8bityonce.near).   A primary drawback to this NFT-based approach is that there is no canonical list of group members. Instead, group membership is inferred from the owners of a NFT per a non-socialDB API - a Mintbase API is used in the above component. 


1. devs.near's groups [defined implicitly by follow-style graph connections](https://near.org/devs.near/widget/every.group). 

A primary drawback to this graph-based approach is that there is no canonical source of group membership. A single group of N members can have M distinct versions of who belongs in that group, where M is the number of group members who decline to "mutually follow" each newly requested group member.  Group membership is managed by an object on the namespace of anyone who has requested access to a group, which contains a group identifier as a key with a value of a list of accountIds (AccountList). Even if no one approves someone's request to join a group, the requestor will retain a valid instance of that groupIdentifer:AccountList on their socialDB namespace - with their accountID included as a group member. This results in muliple versions of graphs which represent the definition of members of a group. For more details on this implementation, see minute 33:45 [here](https://youtu.be/HAyweTF7IjU?si=z_hfct3oK_86nt_o)

With this approach, can we efficiently determine which group members should receive a notification when a post is created on that group's page?  How challenging would it be to ensure that only group members can post to this group's page? There is a solution here, however these implicitly defined group connections with multiple versions of group membership adds complexity. 


1. [Communities on DevHub](https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/Ideas)

DevHub's community implementation exists on a distinct contract from near.social. This results in a lack of discoverability of DevHub's groups across gateways due to its community data not being included in the indexes which power search on socialdB.


## Specification 
Building upon the NFT-based groups implementation, we would benefit from the following the creation and maintanence of two [Core Social Indexers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OmYzMYX60lBm2U2Ridz6GZCeN_A6IcU_qn-yPwLTfs/edit#heading=h.nfrlp9tpavvv):

1. A dataplatform.near Core Social indexer for NFT_Groups, that tracks posts to main which include a groupContractId, e.g. writes to post.main.[groupContractId], and provides an API which lists all of the groups which have been created in socialDB. 
	1. To support the ability to search for groups, where search text is matched against the group's metadata such as name, symbol, description, and spec, the above indexer should fetch and store this metadata from a source such as the [Mintbase API](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.mintbase.xyz%2Fmainnet&header=mb-api-key%3Aanon&query=query+MyQuery+%7B%0A++nft_metadata%28%0A++++where%3A+%7Breference%3A+%7B_eq%3A+%22nb0-oBR379DzoFYeYv-LesjVNmrVlDs5IqQ8hfDfnMU%22%7D%7D%0A++%29+%7B%0A++++id%0A++++media%0A++++reference_blob%0A++%7D%0A%7D%0A

1. A dataplatform.near Core Social indexer for Group_Members, that maintains a list of NFT owners for each NFT_Group, and provides an API which serves a list of all AccountIds which belong to a group.


## Drawbacks

- The NFT-based groups implementation shifts the responsibility of valid NFT management onto users. However, gateways can mitigate this with a Mintbase integration or the ContractWizardUI to faciliate the creation of NFTs.

- The ability to forcibly remove someone from a group, e.g. for violating group guidelines, might not exist - depending on the functionality of the NFT contract for a given group. A potential workaround would be to 'moderate' the user by blocking their posts or banning their account - this would be gateway specific. A gateway could also offer a 'recommended' path for creating a group that includes the creation of an NFT collection with a contract that includes rules that allows the group creator to initiate a transfer to allow the removal of the NFT from any holder.


## Prototype
To faciliate the review of this SEP, a minimal prototype should include the following: 
1. The two indexers mentioned in `##Specification`
1. Near.org UI components, similar to similar to mob.near/widget/N.Group?groupId=v0.8bityonce.near, which leverage the new indexers to support:
	 showing  list of group members
	 allow only group members to post to a group
	 the creation of a new group by providing a NFT contractID. 
1. Near.org UI component that supports searching for groups by name, symbol, description, or spec

## Alternatives
1. Adjacent to root level socialDB accounts, introduce a new top level object called `groups`.  

Where each group object contains the following required fields: 

- a unique identifier: String
- originating gateway: String
- members: [AccountList](https://github.com/NearSocial/standards/blob/main/types/common/AccountList.md)
- metadata: [Metadata](https://github.com/NearSocial/standards/blob/main/types/common/Metadata.md?plain=1)

`{
	"alice.near": {...},
	"mob.near": {...},
	"groups" : [
		{
			"1290387aslkdjf09182": {
				"gateway": "near.org",
				"members": {
					"alice.near": "",
					"bob.near": "",
				},
				metadata: {
				"name": "zksync fans"
					...
				},
			}
		},
		{
			"00110357asiedjf0935t": {
				"gateway": "near.social",
				"members": {
					"gauthamravi.near": "",
					"mob.near": "",
					"root.near": "",
				},
				metadata: {
					"name": "thebestgroup", 
					...
				},

			}
		}
		...
	]
}`

This alternative is suboptimal because 
- It breaks the socialDB pattern of top level objects being Accounts
- Restricting non-group members from writing to a group's namespace would require an extension of socialdB's permissions management; increasing its complexity. 
- It would require more implementation time and cross-ecosystem coordination.



# Potential Impact and Dependencies
//TBD
Here we aim to be mindful of our environment and generate empathy towards others who may be impacted by our decisions.

- *What other systems or teams are affected by this proposal?*
- *How could this be exploited by malicious attackers?*


# Unresolved questions

- How might a group owner/admin or member deal with malicous group members?



**Checklist:**

- [X]  Share as WIP with folks you trust, to gut-check
- [X]  Publish to the dedicated github space
- [ ]  Build a prototype that demonstrates the implications on all related features (notifications, posts, etc)
- [ ]  Assign reviewers (take a look at previous SEPs for suggestions)


**Recommendations**

- If there are areas that you're not convinced on, tag people who you consider may know about this and ask for their input.
- If you have doubts, ask in the Telegram NearSocial group for help moving something forward.
- The success of the implementation of your proposal depends on how the prototype demonstrates end-to-end considerations, and consensus decisions of the maintainers of github.com/nearsocial/standards.
